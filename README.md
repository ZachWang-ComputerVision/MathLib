# MathLib

This project includes basic math and deep learning functions with C++. User can choose either run on CPU or GPU (CUDA). If the program is ran on CPU, some functions may utilize multi-thread to calculate the result.

My focus is in Computer Vision, so functions that are implemented in this project are the ones I use regularly. The purpose of creating this project is to get myself familiar with C++ and CUDA programming.

I use C++ native data types, int and float. I plan to implement the following functions:


- [x] zeros, ones, bool, random, null/empty, is_null, Eye
- [ ] Vector Multiplication, Dot Product, Cross Product
- [ ] Reshape, Concatenate, Squeeze, Unsqueez, Transpose, Permutate
- [ ] Linear Layer, Multi-Layer, 
- [ ] BatchNorm2D, Sigmoid, ReLU
- [ ] Convolution2D
- [ ] ModuleList
- [ ] SGD, Adam
- [ ] Autograd
- [ ] Load, Save Weights

- [ ] Multi-Thread
- [ ] CUDA
