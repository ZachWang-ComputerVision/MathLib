# NNLib

This project is programmed solely with C++. The objective is to build basic matrix operations for deep learning functions. User can choose either run on CPU or GPU (CUDA). If the program is ran on CPU, some functions may utilize multi-thread to calculate the result. My focus is in Computer Vision, so functions that are implemented in this project are the ones I use regularly, but I have plans to continuously develop it.

I use C++ native data types, int and double. Here are the functions:

- [x] Zeros, Ones, Bool, Random, Eye
- [x] Slice, Reshape, Concatenate, Transpose, Permutate
- [x] Matrix Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- [x] Matrix Dot Product
- [x] Linear Layer, Multi-Layer Perceptron
- [x] BatchNorm2D, LayerNorm
- [x] Sigmoid, ReLU
- [x] Convolution2D
- [x] SGD, Adam
- [x] Autograd
- [ ] Load, Save Weights

- [ ] Multi-Thread
- [ ] CUDA
